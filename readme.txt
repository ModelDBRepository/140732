Properties and Functional Implications of Ih in Hippocampal Area CA3 Interneurons
Anderson et al., 2011, Pflugars Archives

The folders contain sample code for the simulations underlying Fig 6, Fig 7 and Fig S6. 

* For Fig 6, open the corresponding folder and execute Fig6BC.m. Functions will be called 
to generate voltage traces, impedance curves, and phase plots identical to those in panels 
B and C.

* For Fig 7, execute Fig7ACD.m to generate the traces shown in panels A, Ca, and Cb.

* Finally, we included code for simulated voltage-clamp of our Ih model (Fig 6A, and Fig S6). 
Execute VClamp_Activation.m to generate a family of curves showing h-current responses to the 
voltage-clamp protocol for activation of gh (Fig 1C).
